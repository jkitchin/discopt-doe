"""General ANOVA analysis for balanced experimental designs.

Computes Type-I (sequential) sums of squares for main effects and
optional interactions in any balanced design where each level of each
factor appears the same number of times in the response column. Works
for Latin-square family designs, full and fractional factorials,
randomized complete blocks, and one-way layouts. For unbalanced data
the function still runs but emits a warning -- Type-I SS may then
depend on factor order.

The standard decomposition for orthogonal balanced data is

    SS_total = sum_i SS_main_i + sum_(i,j) SS_interaction_ij + SS_residual

with degrees of freedom

    df_factor   = n_levels(factor) - 1
    df_interact = prod(n_levels(f) - 1 for f in factors)
    df_residual = N - 1 - sum(df_factors) - sum(df_interactions)

F-statistics and p-values are computed against the residual mean square
via the F-distribution survival function.

"""Fractional factorial designs built by MILP row selection.

A full :math:`2^k` factorial doubles in size with every new factor and
becomes unaffordable past ``k = 7`` or so. A **fractional factorial**
picks :math:`2^{k-p}` of those :math:`2^k` corners so that:

* the chosen subset still spans all :math:`k` factors (every main effect
  is estimable), and
* the columns of the model matrix that we still want to estimate are
  **pairwise orthogonal**, so OLS coefficients have no within-set
  confounding.

The classical generator algebra (defining contrasts, words like
``I = ABCD``) is one way to construct such a fraction. This module takes
a different route: it formulates the row-selection problem as a small
MILP and lets discopt's solver pick the runs.

Formulation
-----------

Let :math:`c_{r,i} \\in \\{-1, +1\\}` be the coded level of factor
:math:`i` in row :math:`r` of the full :math:`2^k` factorial, and let
:math:`x_r \\in \\{0, 1\\}` indicate whether row :math:`r` is kept. For
each pair of effect columns :math:`(u, v)` that we want mutually
orthogonal,

.. math::

    \\sum_{r=1}^{2^k} u_r \\, v_r \\, x_r = 0,

together with :math:`\\sum_r x_r = n_{\\text{runs}}`. Which pairs we
enforce depends on the requested **resolution**:

* **Resolution III** (default): all pairs among
  :math:`\\{I, m_1, \\dots, m_k\\}`. Main effects are clear of one
  another but may be aliased with two-factor interactions.
* **Resolution IV**: resolution-III pairs, plus
  :math:`m_i \\perp m_j m_l` for all distinct triples :math:`(i, j, l)`.
  Equivalently, every three-factor-interaction column is balanced over
  the kept rows. Main effects are clear of any 2FI.
* **Resolution V**: all pairs among
  :math:`\\{I, m_1, \\dots, m_k\\} \\cup \\{m_i m_j : i < j\\}`. Mains
  and two-factor interactions are all mutually orthogonal.

When to use this
----------------

* You have ``k = 4 ... 12`` factors and want a **screening** design but
  cannot afford the full :math:`2^k` corners.
* You want main effects unconfounded with each other (R = III), or with
  two-factor interactions as well (R = IV), or you want to estimate the
  full main + 2FI model (R = V).

If you do not need the structured orthogonality and just want a small
parameter-estimation-friendly design, an exact D-optimal design via
:func:`discopt.doe.optimal_experiment` on a linear template will
typically be the better choice -- it does not constrain the runs to lie
on the :math:`\\{-1, +1\\}` lattice and adapts to your prior model.

Notes on infeasibility
----------------------

Not every (``k``, ``n_runs``, ``resolution``) combination is feasible.
A resolution-V design with ``k = 5`` needs at least 16 runs; a
resolution-IV design with ``k = 4`` needs at least 8. When the MILP
returns infeasible the function raises ``ValueError`` with the
parameter combination and a suggested minimum size.

    Parameters
    ----------
    factors : mapping name -> (low, high)
        Two-level factors. Numeric or categorical levels are both
        accepted; categorical levels are coded :math:`-1, +1` for the
        MILP and substituted back into output rows.
    n_runs : int, optional
        Number of corner runs to keep (per replicate, excluding center
        points). Must be a power of 2 in :math:`[k+1,\\, 2^k]`. Defaults
        to the smallest power of 2 that is feasible for the requested
        resolution (``max(k+1, 8)`` rounded up).
    resolution : int, default 3
        Required resolution (3, 4, or 5). See module docstring.
    extra_pairs : list of (str, str), optional
        Additional **factor-name pairs** whose two-factor interaction
        column should be orthogonal to every main effect (i.e. clear of
        aliasing with mains). Useful for R=III designs where the user
        knows a particular 2FI matters and wants it estimable
        separately from the mains.
    center_points : int, default 0
        Center-point runs added per replicate (numeric factors only).
    replicates : int, default 1
        Number of times to replicate the selected fraction.
    seed : int, optional
        Seed for run-order randomization (the MILP itself is
        deterministic).
    time_limit : float, default 60.0
        Solver wall-clock limit in seconds.

    Returns

        Rows are tagged with ``replicate``, ``run_order``, and
        ``is_center`` exactly like :func:`factorial_2level_design`,

        unchanged.
